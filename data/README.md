# Dataset

For inductive link prediction tasks, we use datasets proposed in the paper [Inductive Relation Prediction by Subgraph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06962). Before training our MorsE, please download the data from [GraIL](https://github.com/kkteru/grail/tree/master/data), and directly put these datasets in the ```data``` folder in our repository.
